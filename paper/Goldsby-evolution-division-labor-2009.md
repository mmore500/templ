## synopsis

The paper uses Avida to understand how cooperative arrangements where certain roles are more advantageous than others.
Goldsby investigated two role assignment mechanisms:
  1. Avidians set a role-id register to specify which role they play
  2. Avidians carry out one of a set of complex bitwise operations, each operation specifying a unique role.
Group level selection was performed by direct competition between demes.
The fitness of a deme was calculated as the number of distinct roles performed by its members.
In some experiments a quota was set for the number of individuals it was desirable to have accomplish a certain role.
In those experiments, the difference between the number of individuals targeted to a certain role versus the number of individuals actually playing a certain role was subtracted from deme fitness.
With respect to competition within a deme, an individual received a variable fitness benefit based on which role they assumed.

Division of labor was observed to emerge in all experiments performed with group level selection for division of labor (even with unequal rewards for different roles).
Stronger individual-level selection, however, reduces the capacity of demes to precisely match a deme-level quota for the number of individuals that should be carrying out a particular role.
More individuals than called for by the quota tend to carry out that role if it is especially beneficial to individual fitness.

## misc

It would be interesting to see a similar experiment with a less heavy-handed group selection mechanism.
Individual fitness would be calculated as a sum of group cooperation benefit and the individual role benefit.
Individual cooperators, not an entire cooperating deme, would have to invade existing demes.
It might be necessary to perform some sort of random group assignments.
On second thought, I'm not sure that cooperative behavior would arise from this experimental setup.

I wonder how the frequency of deme competitions would affect the amount of division of labor observed.
How could within-deme diversity be preserved over longer periods of time between deme competition?
