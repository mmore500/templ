+ research and dissertation
+ other departmental requirements

It's **YOUR** responsibility to know the rules.

where to get help:
+ advisor
+ department graduate secretary

  + Dr. Katy Colbry
  + others
+ informal sources
  + Dr. Katy Colbry
  + websites
  + other students

elements of success
+ passion for research and learning
+ work hard
+ perseverance
+ ask questions -- lots of them
+ strive to become a peer with your advisor (know more about your research topic than he/she does)

Katy's office is 2420 Engineering.
Katy does non-academic advising -- everything other than which classes to take and how to pass your qualifying exams.
Come talk about calibrating -- is it normal graduate school weird or is there something wrong.
Schedule appointments online ([https://colbryka.youcanbookme.com](https://colbryka.youcanbookme.com)).
Email is a good way to get in touch, too.

### Rules & Regulations
Know that there are rules.
Know where to find them.


#### Within your department
Read your graduate handbook.
You need a copy of the departmental handbook for this semester.
What is your backup plan? (MS?)

#### Within your college

##### responsible conduct of research (RCR)
+ what/why?
  + behaving in the most ethical manner responsible
  + honesty
  + accuracy
  + objectivity
  + fairness
  + giving credit where credit is due
  + the work that you do might actually impact people... it does matter! (handheld device... iPhone hangup example)
+ how?
  + there is an old plan and a new plan... we are on the new plan
  + first year requirements: due by December 31 of the current year
    + four modules at citiprogram.org
  + second year requirements: worry about it next year
  + discussion-based training:
    + at least six hours
    + look in your graduate handbook, if no specification anything you and your advisor agree to
    + this counts as an hour of RCR training!
    + track and report your self
    + round up to whole hour increments
  + annual refresher training: third year onwards
  + must be done by your comprehensive exam

##### annual reports
+ documents PRIOR year's activities
+ outlines academic and career goals (and progress)
+ identifies challenges and ares for development
+ faculty advisor provides feedback
+ can serve as a kind of contract for graduation requirements (a written record)
+ January 31: students enter their information in online report
+ February: advisors provide written feedback in online report
+ March 1 hard deadline (hold on account)

### What to expect this year
It gets really hard then it gets better.
Right after thanksgiving is hard!
(Don't go home).
Graduate students are very smart -- but, so are you.
We picked you to be here!
In coursework, you are encouraged to be collaborative and supportive.

Olin Health Center -- three visits each academic year **FREE** and all services are confidential.
MSU Counseling Center -- support groups specifically for grad students as well as individual and small group counseling, as needed.
This is also confidential.
Katy will help you get set up if you need these services.

### Division of Engineering Computing Services (DECs)
+ technology resource and IT support unit for the College of Engineering
+ you need an account through engineering (separate from MSU account)
+ engineering email (don't give out, but you get announcements here)
+ network file storage and backups (where is your thesis stored? your research stored?)
+ access to engineering site licensed software and resources
+ reach out via `support@egr.msu.edu`
+ use research space! (the `R:` drive) this is hardcore and space is available through your advisor
+ SSH and SFTP access is available via `scully.egr.msu.edu`
+ Linux compute servers are also available
+ DECS and MSU will never ask for your password (engineering students are frequently targets of phishing attacks)
+ can print poster, 3D parts, can check out a cheap laptop to take to a conference as well as other equipment

### How not to die!
+ fire alarm switches are by the exit doors
+ go to your rally site in an emergency evacuation (there are several)
+ don't be a hero -- go get a first responder

+ no chemicals down the sink and no needles in the garbage
+ accidents happen, don't hide it!
+ Environmental Health & Safety (24/7/365)

## misc

There are 100 undergraduates for each PhD students at the college of engineering.
There are more than twice as many PhD students as masters students.

Don't come to campus to work on home football weekends.
Your badge and parking pass won't work.

You need to get a bike permit.

The dean says the best time in your life is when you're done with classes and six months before you defend.
You get to focus on one thing and be "the world's expert."
When you finish you're going to be to valuable to work on just one thing...
Graduate school is less about being a student and more about being a colleague.
Be nice to the graduate secretary; "most important person to please."
Go green! Go white!
