## synopsis

Discussed mathematical and biological examples of randomness.

For mathematical results, students are tripped up by outcomes that are not equally likely and the number of possible outcomes.
Students are also tripped up by when information is revealed.

Students argue that both clumped and unclumped dots are random.

Students are able to apply randomness to biology, but have mathematical misconceptions of randomness.

Students have atomized discrete concepts that they are having trouble linking together.

## misc

A student believes that physics students are better at rolling dice.
Another student believes that certain people have psychic powers that allow them to predict what's on the other side of cards.
