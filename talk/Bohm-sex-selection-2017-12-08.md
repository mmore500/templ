## synopsis

Sensory bias hypothesis: one sex uses pre-existing sensory bias of other (choosy) sex to get more mating opportunity.

Sequential filters hypothesis:
* avoid predation
* find food
* get mates

Is it possible to for sexual selection to act in opposition to natural selection?

Cliff's 3 axioms:
1. there is always selection
2. selection can only act on
  a. display traits with detectable variation
  b. display traits which females can choose for
3. both the display traits and selection must arise from mutation or recombination
  a. optimization should not be assumed

(Only applies to genetic traits where females select for males).

Hypothesis: stable sexual traits should oppose survival (but only a little).
