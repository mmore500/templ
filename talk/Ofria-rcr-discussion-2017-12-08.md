## synopsis

RCR discussion during our weekly lab meeting.

Authors should participate in two of these tree realms:
* writing,
* data collection/analysis, and
* intellectual contribution.

Random seeds:
* don't use the same sets random seeds for different treatments
* except maybe for experiments with explicitly paired runs, but even then you're better off explicitly designing your experiments to have the same initial conditions

If you're going to do it, do it intentionally.
Test to make sure things are as you expect.

## misc

Diane worked with Navy dolphins for her dissertation research!

There was once a graduate student named Less Moore.
