## R markdown

You can use a single R markdown file to both
* save and execute code
* generate a beautiful report to share with an audience.

In R markdown, each report contains the code it needs to make its own graphs, tales, numbers, etc.. It is self contained!

You can label chunks, turn off echoing of original code, or turn off evaluation of code, and do inline code.

Yay!
Wooo!
