## Capstone project architecture
classes:
* environment [template]
    * generate random environmental condition
    * apply noise to environment
    * YAML string
* chemical concentration set
    * generate random chemical concentration set
    * apply noise to chemical concentration set
* genotype (rule set) [template]
    * rule set
    * generate skeletonized network (another genotype)
    * YAML string
* phenotype [template]
    * end set of chemical concentrations
    * define distance between two phenotypes
    * YAML string
* fitness [template]
    * components
    * net
* development (genotype, environment -> phenotype) [template]
    * update function that takes a chemical concentration set and a rule set to generate next chemical concentration set
* scoring (phenotype -> fitness) [template]
    * takes chemical concentration set and uses Conway's GOL to evaluate
* evaluation [template]
    * development [template]
        * defines function lifespan that takes scoring, environment, genotype as args and returns score
        * YAML string
    * trial [template]
        * environment [template] is a chemical concentration set
        * scoring [template] is a scoring function
        * weighting double
        * noise double
        * YAML string
    * evaluation has list of trials, returns a fitness object
    * repeated evaluations
    * YAML string
* individual [template]
    * genotype
    * phenotype
    * fitness
    * string describing evaluation
    * can output to YAML file
* offspring collection (10000 offspring generated by mutation of parent) [template]
    * constructed from evaluation, mutation operator, and parent
    * access phenotypic distances, relative fitnesses

## meeting notes with Dr. Ofria
* evolutionary transitions books --- ordered
* NSF GRFP revisions --- in progress
* GRN structural analysis for Capstone project
    * how: look at skeletonizing the genotype and looking at knockout pairs
