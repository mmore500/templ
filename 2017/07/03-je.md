I saw man at the UW gym today with no shirt to speak of.
It was no case of a negligible tank top or one of those tshirts cut down the sides that hangs like a traffic safety vest.
He was plainly bare-chested.
At some point, the thought occurred to him: maybe I don't need a shirt.
Who's going to stop me?
