## todo

### low priority
* read information articles recommended by Chris Adami at BEACON
    * [Adami, 2012]
    * [Adami, 2016]
* transfer evolvability content to blog articles
* sign up for health insurance
* check on BPS exterior door access

### high priority
* data analysis on evolvability grn experiments
* NSF GRFP revisions to broader impacts

## done
* BEACON Congress
* BEACON Congress poster
* reach out to investigate ASE-like programs in the midwest

## data analysis ideas
* analyzing self-directed behavior of chemical elements (i.e. what is the average length of the shortest path in a genotype graph from a chemical element to itself, do chemical elements tend to act on themselves in an inhibitory or excitatory manner?)
* looking to see if mutations are activating developmental path-switching behavior on indirect plasticity cases (i.e. do phenotypes resulting from mutation resemble the phenotype typically developed to satisfy the secondary objective under the secondary environmental cue)
* count which proportion of nodes have both positive and negative incoming edges (i.e. are upregulated by some chemicals and downregulated by others)
* count which proportion of nodes have both positive and negative outgoing edges (i.e. downregulate some chemicals and upregulate others)
* analyze fitness consequences of single (and maybe pairwise?) point perturbations of the phenotype

## misc

Mike Wiser's name tag at the BEACON Congress read: Mike Wiser; Mad Scientist; Michigan State University.
Mike noticed that he could manually edit the autopopulated "role" field on the sign up form.
The BEACON folks will let you put anything there, so long as it's not offensive.
He asked.
