# Matthew Moreno progress report 8-16-2017

## work from last week
* NSF GRFP revisions
* completed data production - data analysis pipeline for plastic grn experiment
* read through Goldsby papers and Adami's recommended reading on information theory
* de-tex-ified thesis content to prepare to post on blog

## work for next week
* test additional experimental conditions to try to replicate results from previous plastic grn experiment
  * test indirect plasticity experiment with crossover enabled
  * test direct plasticity with harsher noise treatment
* continue reading through Goldsby papers

## obstacles
* using yaml data format to save experimental data was a mistake, the Python parser for this format is extremely slow on large files... so I had to break down the large files and parallelize the process
* de-tex-ifying content is a pain in the neck

## agenda
* NSF GRFP
  * personal statement
    * introduction
    * how NSF GRFP would help me (conclusion)
  * research statement
    * broader impacts of research statement
* preliminary results from plasticity experiments
  * indirect plasticity results didn't replicate
    * turned on crossover (which had been present in previous experiment) to see if it is necessary for these results to replicate
  * direct plasticity results seem to replicate increase in silent outcomes (p \\approx 0.15)
    * used a weaker direct plasticity treatment (less noise) compared to original experiment, so rerunning experiment with a harsher direct plasticity treatment
