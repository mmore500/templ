# Matthew Moreno progress report 12-7-2017
## work from last week
* communicating science workshop + blog post
* evolutionary computing project wrapped up and written up

## work for next week
* wrap up deep learning project and homework
* start developing implementation of signal-reward (need a name for this...) environment I showed off a few lab meetings back
* figure out next steps for evolutionary computing project

## obstacles

## agenda

I'm looking forward to your comments on my evolutionary computing project.
In particular, I'm looking for some guidance on finding a domain for which the autoencoder genotype-phenotype mappings I developed would be well-suited.
(I demonstrated the maps on a toy problem for the project.
I think the next step is demonstrating them in a less contrived scenario).

We should also make sure that I'm squared away with EEBB.
