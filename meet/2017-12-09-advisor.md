# advisor meeting for 12-09-2017

## rundown

Ideas from Dr. Ofria for extensions to my ec class project:
* inverse problems
* Eric Goodman
* puzzles --- evolving a puzzle so you get a certain solving experience
* Sodoku (take away instead of generate)
* any np complete problem! traveling salesman, vertices
* online version of the techniques (i.e. maps are trained during evolution process by encountered phenotypes; he mentioned that an ecological setup might be interesting to ensure that lots of fitness peaks are explored)

## todo

* enroll in EEBB
